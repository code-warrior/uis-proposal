# UIS Proposal for NIME (Fall 2020)

## Tentative Title/Topic of Proposed Course
New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME): Creating and Composing Unique Interactive Performances

---

## Please Describe the Proposed Course
In this course, students will learn how to create a New Interface for Musical Expression, or NIME. They will understand how to effectively map sensory data onto custom interfaces designed to generate sound as an expressive musical instrument. Using a strong, hands-on approach, students will learn about electronic music composition, sound design, synthesis, effects processing, musical form, structure, development, and nonstandard notational principles. The course will culminate in an end-of-semester concert where students will perform original works, complete with NIME-specific notation, composed to showcase their NIMEs.

## Active Learning
We will employ [Harvard’s “group work” and “collaborative note-taking” active learning concepts](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/active-learning) to teach students how to build circuits, solder electronic components, and test sensors. For group work, we will pair a student who identifies as a musician with one who identifies as an engineer. In this manner, musicians will help engineers with musical concepts, and engineers will help musicians with engineering concepts.

For collaborative note-taking, students will be given time to review each other’s notes for mistakes. At the end of class, students will consolidate their individual notes into a “master” note sheet that may be used by both students. (Cornell’s active learning methodologies include a similar concept called [“catch-up”](https://teaching.cornell.edu/resource/getting-started-active-learning-techniques).)

We will carry out the aforementioned by oscillating between [lecture and activity](https://cei.umn.edu/sites/cei.umn.edu/files/upload/active_learning_time_management_approach.jpg) at a ratio of 3:1 or 2:1, depending on the material. For example, for every 12 minutes of lecture we’ll break for 4 minutes of activities. Or, for every 20 minutes of lecture we’ll break for 10 minutes of activities. Each class will begin with a session breakdown and end with a summary.

Because of the amount of material we need to cover, we estimate that an active learning model will be observed for 40–50% of the semester.
